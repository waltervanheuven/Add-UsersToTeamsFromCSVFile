Get-InstalledScript
```

## Show Help

```powershell

```

#Â Installation on macOS

Install latest PowerShell using [brew](https://brew.sh) and start the PowerShell.

```bash
brew cask install powershell
pwsh
```

## Install MicrosoftTeams and check the installed modules

```powershell
Install-Module -Name MicrosoftTeams -RequiredVersion 1.1.5-preview -AllowPrerelease -force -AllowClobber
Get-Module -ListAvailable
```

## Install Add-UsersToTeamsFromCSVFile from the PowerShellGallery and check installed scripts

```powershell
Install-Script -Name Add-UsersToTeamsFromCSVFile
Get-InstalledScript
```

Note that there is an issue with the PowerShell on macOS. The script path is not included in the search path and therefore installed scripts from the [powershellgallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com) are not found. You can find the installed location of the script using this command

```powershell
Get-InstalledScript -Name "Add-UsersToTeamsFromCSVFile" | Format-List InstalledLocation
```

Use that location when starting the script.

Start script then with:

```powershell
/Users/[YOUR_USERNAME]/.local/share/powershell/Scripts/Add-UsersToTeamsFromCSVFile.ps1
```
